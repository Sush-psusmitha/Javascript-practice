    <h1>CallBack fucntions</h1>
    <p>Passing a function inside another function as an argument is know as Callback Functions</p>
    <p>it forms a relationship between 2 functions</p>

    <h2>Callback Hell</h2>
    <p>when the function have the more nested functions and it's stucture is looks like paramid this is know as callback hell.</p>
     
    <b>to prevent the callback hell we use promises</b>
