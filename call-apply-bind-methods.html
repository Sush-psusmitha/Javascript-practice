    <h2>Call(), apply(), Bind() - methods</h2>
    <p>All these methods are used for method/functions borrowing/sharing. <br>
1. call method is used to call the function with the given this value and argument can be passed individually. <br>
2. apply method is similar to call method, the only difference is that instead of passing argument individually, will pass the argument in a list/array. <br>
3. bind method is similar to call method. It is also used to override this value, but the difference is it will not invoke the function instantly but return a function with attached this and argument which can be called later.</p>

// apply() => same like call but while invoking a function we pass arguments inside the array.

// call method used for borrowing the methods from one obj to another
